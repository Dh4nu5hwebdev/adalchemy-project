# AdAlchemy

AdAlchemy is a web application that allows users to quickly generate promotional banners (e.g., "10% off on Coca Cola") with custom text and styles. The app stores the history of generated banners in a Firebase database for easy access and management. Banner images are generated using the Gemini API.

## Features

- **Custom Banner Generation:** Input your own promotional text and instantly create eye-catching banners.
- **AI-Powered Images:** Uses the Gemini API to generate banner images based on your input.
- **Banner History:** All generated banners are saved and can be viewed later.
- **Firebase Integration:** Securely stores banner history using Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive UI for fast banner creation.
